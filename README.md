# ðŸŒŸ The Missing 78%: Women in AI & Data ðŸŒŸ

Welcome to this space dedicated to **Noor Aftabâ€™s passionate mission** to spotlight the deep gender gap in AI and data science â€” where women make up just 22% of the global AI workforce. But this isnâ€™t just about numbers â€” itâ€™s about the **critical loss of diverse voices** essential for building ethical, effective, and inclusive AI systems.

As the **IBM Women in AI User Group Lead** and an advocate for inclusive innovation, Noor draws from her talks at **PyData Global 2024**, **SciPy 2025**, and other global platforms to show how this imbalance leads to biased algorithms, overlooked needs, and missed opportunities for innovation.

Here youâ€™ll find:
âœ… **Resources**  
âœ… **Slides**  
âœ… **Case studies**  
âœ… **Actionable tools**  

These materials are designed to help you **join the movement**. Noorâ€™s broader work â€” through **IBM Women in AI, TechWomen mentorship, and leadership roles at NumFOCUS** â€” is all about creating diverse communities where every voice matters.

âœ¨ **Ready to help close the gap?**  
Dive in, explore the materials, and consider joining the contributor list to become part of this vital mission. Together, we can help shape an AI future designed *by everyone, for everyone*.
