# 🌟 The Missing 78%: Women in AI & Data 🌟

This project is part of **Noor Aftab’s mission** to spotlight the gender gap in AI and data science — where women make up just 22% of the global AI workforce. This gap isn’t just a number; it represents the **critical loss of diverse voices** essential for building ethical, effective, and inclusive AI systems.

## 📌 What’s Inside

- Resources and research on women’s representation in AI and data
- Slides and materials from Noor’s talks at **PyData Global 2024**, **SciPy 2025**, and beyond
- Case studies and tools to help advance gender inclusion in tech
