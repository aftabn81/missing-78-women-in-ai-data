But this isnâ€™t just about numbers â€” itâ€™s about the critical loss of diverse voices essential for building ethical, effective, and inclusive AI systems.\n\nAs the IBM Women in AI User Group Lead and an advocate for inclusive innovation, Noor draws from her talks at PyData Global 2024, SciPy 2025, and other global platforms to show how this imbalance leads to biased algorithms, overlooked needs, and missed opportunities for innovation.\n\nHere youâ€™ll find:\nâœ… Resourcesâœ… Slidesâœ… Case studiesâœ… Actionable tools\n\nThese materials are designed to help you join the movement. Noorâ€™s broader work â€” through IBM Women in AI, TechWomen mentorship, and leadership roles at NumFOCUS â€” is all about creating diverse communities where every voice matters.\n\nâœ¨ Ready to help close the gap?Dive in, explore the materials, and consider joining the contributor list to become part of this vital mission.
